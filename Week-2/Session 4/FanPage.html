        composed of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis,
        guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio. Performing in the
        streets in its early days, it rose to prominence after finishing second
        in the eleventh season of the Italian version of X Factor in 2017. Its
        international breakthrough occurred when the foursome won the Eurovision
