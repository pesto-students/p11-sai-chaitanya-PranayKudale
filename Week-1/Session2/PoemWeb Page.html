    I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! they'd advertise - you know!<br>
</p>
<p>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
    To an admiring Bog!<br>
</p>
